# Teknowledge's Curriculum
Teknowledge's mission is to create a introductory CS curriculum for text-based programming. 

The current curriculum is being developed targeting 7th-10th grade students in Pittsburgh, though we aim to share it as widely as it finds use.

> **Important Note**
> This curriculum is currently *in development* and undergoing major revisions and is not licensed for general use.  Please email cmu.teknowledge@gmail.com before using, modifying, or sharing this curriculum.

# Using This Curriculum

This curriculum is meant to be used in eight lessons, running 60 to 75 minutes long, that each roughly follow this format:
* (15 minutes) a short (!) lecture teaching the syntax guide and new concepts
* (rest of time) students work through the coding files in order
 * encourage them to ask questions of instructors/mentors as they need help (ideally you have small groups of 2-4 students with one mentor each)
 * encourage them to collaborate together with each other to ask questions and help each other, but also to NEVER mindlessly copy someone else's code that they don't understand (that is where your learning will stop, wastes the time spent on finishing the file, and majorly hurts your future learning and future abilities)
* The coding files that have _fun in the name are meant as take-home fun challenges, and are optional.
 * They are also designed to give learners who get ahead in the work time something to do! However, they also add a lot of fun to the lessons and often bring together the concepts in a very cool way! They could even serve to split one lesson into two lessons, since most of them are more extensive and tougher challenges.
 * Note that sometimes they utilize some advanced concepts and syntax not in the curriculum overview list below or in the syntax guide, but usually explain those new concepts in coding comments or don't need to be understood or modified to complete the challenge.
 * The last three lessons don't have _fun files; instead, the last activity offers an extensive bonus challenge that can serve as the take-home fun challenge.

# Overall Curricular Goals

* Fun: Build students' interest in coding - "This is cool."
* Mastery: Build students' skills and confidence in coding - "I can do this."
* Inspiration: Inspire and motivate students' understanding of what kinds of problems and creative projects code is useful for - "I want to try doing this idea I have with code."

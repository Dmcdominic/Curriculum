# Who/what is Teknowledge?
Teknowledge's mission is to create a introductory CS curriculum for text-based programming. 

The current curriculum is being developed targeting 7th-8th grade students in Pittsburgh, though we aim to share it as widely as it finds use.

Learn more at [teknowledge.xyz](http://teknowledge.xyz).

> **Important Note**: This curriculum is currently *in development* and undergoing major revisions and is not licensed for general use.  Please email cmu.teknowledge@gmail.com before using, modifying, or sharing this curriculum.

# Which directory to use?

[igniteCS_python_track/](https://github.com/Teknowledge/Curriculum/tree/master/igniteCS_python_track) is the latest version of our curriculum.

The other folders are previous iterations of our curriculum, for past reference for the students and schools that used them.

# Using Teknowledge's Curriculum

This curriculum is meant to be used in sixteen lessons, running 60 minutes long, that each roughly follow this format:
* (10-15 minutes) a short (!) lecture teaching the [syntax guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WShlUw59AmkNPsYvtAkbBWEN4OEqkYfQsMHqwyj-i_8/edit?usp=sharing) and new concepts
* (rest of time) students work through the coding files in order
	* encourage them to ask questions of instructors/mentors as they need help (ideally you have small groups of 2-4 students with one mentor each)
	* encourage them to collaborate together with each other to ask questions and help each other, but also to NEVER mindlessly copy someone else's code that they don't understand (that is where your learning will stop, wastes the time spent on finishing the file, and majorly hurts your future learning and future abilities)

# The Syntax Guide

The syntax guide, mentioned above, is used as:
- the guide for the instructor for what to teach before each lesson
- a reference for students while working on the challenges

You can find the syntax guide at this link:

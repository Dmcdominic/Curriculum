a = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"]

# Warmup 1.1 - Print out the list a.
#    Then, print out the length of a.



# Warmup 1.2 - Print out the element "c" from the list using a list index.
#    Then, append "x", "y", and "z" to the list, each individually.
#    Then, print out the element "z" using an index that uses "len(a)".



# Warmup 1.3 - Print out each element on its own line using a "for e in a"
#    loop.



# Warmup 1.4 - Print out each element on its own line using a "for i in 
#    range(len(a))" loop.



# Warmup 1.5 - Print out the list in reverse, each element on its own line.
#    Hint: This should be review from last week, but try to do it without
#    looking at last week's code!



# BONUS Warmup 1.6 - Make a list that is 1000 elements long and print it out.

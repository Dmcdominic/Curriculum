a = ["j", "k", "l", "m", "n", "o", "p"]

# Challenge 1.1 - Write a function, getLastElement(a) that returns the last
#    element in the list.
#    Then, use that function to print the last element of a.
#    Add more elements to a, then try it again to make sure it works with
#    different lengths of lists.



# Challenge 1.2 - Write a function, printEveryOtherElement(a) that loops over
#    the list a, and prints only the items at indexes 0, 2, 4, ...
#    Then, call that function on a to print the elements in a.



# Challenge 1.3 - Write a function, makeTupleList(a) that creates a new empty
#    list, then adds to it a tuple for each element in a, to make a list like
#    the following:
#      [(0, "j"), (1, "k"), (2, "l"), ...]
#    where the first tuple element is the index, and the second tuple element
#    is the element from a at that index.  Then return that list.
#    Reminder: Make sure to test your function by printing



# BONUS Challenge 1.4 - Make a function, addSmiles(a), that returns a list with
#    smiles in between every element from the original list of a.  So if a is:
#      ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
#    addSmiles(a) returns:
#      ["a", ":)", "b", ":)", "c", ":)", "d"]
#    Note: There is no smile after the last element.  :(
